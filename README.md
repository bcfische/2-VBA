The VBA of Wall Street

Here, we use VBA scripting to analyze real stock market data. The idea is to loop through all the stocks and take the following info: 
~Ticker symbol
~Yearly change from where the stock opened the year at to where the closing price was
~Percent change from where it opened the year at to where it closed
~Total volume

We use conditional formatting to highlight positive change in green and negative change in red. The solution also locates the stock with the "Greatest % Increase", "Greatest % Decrease", and "Greatest Total Volume".
